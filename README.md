# odin-recipes
This is my first project for "The Odin Project" course. 
It is a simple website that features three recipes. 
While I haven't necessarily learned anything new about HTML as I already had some practice with it before, I used this occasion to review some of my basic HTML skills while also familiarizing myself with some tools on VSCode that allow for faster coding.
In particular, I've discovered the "Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation" tool (and linked it to a keyboard shortcut), and also the "Multi-cursor" function, both of which I have used to enter list items more quickly. This was a very nice discovery that I think is going to improve my coding efficiency significantly in future projects.
